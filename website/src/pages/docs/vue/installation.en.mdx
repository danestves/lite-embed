# Installation

You can install `@lite-embed/vue` with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/@lite-embed/vue), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/package/@lite-embed/vue), any package manager, or a `<script />` via [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/@lite-embed/vue).

## npm

```bash
npm install @lite-embed/vue
# or
yarn add @lite-embed/vue
```

<Callout emoji="💡">We only support Vue 3 and above at the moment.</Callout>

## CDN

We also have a global ("UMD") build hosted on the unpkg.com CDN if you don't use a module bundler or package manager. Simply put, at the bottom of your HTML file, add the following `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@lite-embed/vue/dist/lite-embed-vue.umd.js"></script>
```

<Callout emoji="💡">
  This installation/use necessitates the presence of the [Vue CDN script
  bundles](https://unpkg.com/vue@3) on the page.
</Callout>
