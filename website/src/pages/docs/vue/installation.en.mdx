<Callout emoji="üí°">We only support Vue 3 and above at the moment.</Callout>

## CDN

We also have a global (‚ÄúUMD‚Äù) build hosted on the unpkg.com CDN if you don't use a module bundler or package manager. Simply put, at the bottom of your HTML file, add the following `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@lite-embed/vue/dist/lite-embed-vue.umd.js"></script>
```

<Callout emoji="üí°">
  This installation/use necessitates the presence of the [Vue CDN script
  bundles](https://unpkg.com/vue@3) on the page.
